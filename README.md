# About me

I’m a results-driven data professional with over 11 years of experience at Apple, including six in AIML Data Operations. I bring deep expertise in Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and Data Annotation, connecting technical precision with business purpose.

My strength lies in identifying bottlenecks, and turning inefficiencies into opportunities. I’m able to see both the data architecture and the organisational system around it, translating between engineers, analysts, and leadership to drive alignment and momentum.

Curious, meticulous, and relentlessly improvement-driven, I thrive in environments where clarity and impact matter as much as code. 

I’m open to opportunities where I can design, build, and optimize modern data systems, driving performance and helping teams work smarter through high-quality data. Let’s connect.
