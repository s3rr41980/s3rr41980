Iâ€™m a results-driven data professional with over 11 years of experience at Apple, including six in AIML Data Operations. I bring deep expertise in Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and Data Annotation, connecting technical precision with business purpose.

My strength lies in identifying bottlenecks, and turning inefficiencies into opportunities. Iâ€™m able to see both the data architecture and the organisational system around it, translating between engineers, analysts, and leadership to drive alignment and momentum.

Curious, meticulous, and relentlessly improvement-driven, I thrive in environments where clarity and impact matter as much as code. 

Iâ€™m open to opportunities where I can design, build, and optimize modern data systems, driving performance and helping teams work smarter through high-quality data. Letâ€™s connect.
